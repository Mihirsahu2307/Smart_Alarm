# Smart-Alarm
 Alarm app which can schedule repeating alarms and allows user to choose an option of waking up by solving some basic arithmetic problems.
 
 ----------------------------
 
 <b>Concepts learnt and used</b> (for self reference):
 1) Using service class and receivers to enable background functioning of an app.
 2) Scheduling tasks of an app (This is not straightforward if you want tasks to repeat on specific days of a week or month).
 3) Creating a custom movable view with enabled gesture detection by modification of FAB.
 4) Loopers and handlers to start a new thread.
 5) Customizing views programatically.
 6) Code maintenance and reusability.


<i>Also learnt kotlin and made my first project in kotlin.</i>
